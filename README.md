# Python_Introduction

# Description
This repository is used for documenting my python learning journey. I plan to complete two main projects and complete several mini-project with each lesson. Within each lesson I also answer questions related to python and explain my code and reasoning.

# Project Goal
Users should be able to create and modify recipes with ingredients, cooking time, and a difficulty
parameter that would be automatically calculated by the app. Users should also be able to search for
recipes by their ingredients.

# Key Features
- Create and manage the userâ€™s recipes on a locally hosted MySQL database.
- Option to search for recipes that contain a set of ingredients specified by the user.
- Automatically rate each recipe by their difficulty level.
- Display more details on each recipe if the user prompts it, such as the ingredients, cooking time,
and difficulty of the recipe.

# Dependencies
- Python
