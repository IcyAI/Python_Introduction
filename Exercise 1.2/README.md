# Step 1
I chose a string to represent the Name, because names of recipes/food are words and words are strings. I chose an int to represent the cooking_time, because cooking time is normally measured with whole numbers. Lastly I used a list to list the ingredients, because a list can be edited if further ingredients must be added.

# Step 3
I chose a Dictionary to represent the all_recipies data type, because I felt a user could easily assign a key to each recipe they save. For example the key could be recipe_1 or the name of the actual recipe. I also feel like Dictionaries are easy to manipulate if the user wants to change a recipe or add/delete a recipe
